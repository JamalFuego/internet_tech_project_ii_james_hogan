            <h3>Jamal Fuego</h3>
                <p>His name itself combines words from Arabic and Spanish. Jamal (Arabic) Fuego (Spanish) translates to "The Beauty of Fire" - the interpretation of the name is up to the listener. 

                Jamal Fuego is a multi-genre music producer, recording artist, songwriter, and engineer. Born in Flores, Guatemala and residing in the United States since adoption at a young age, he has been immersed in a complex cultural spectrum. 
                    
                Growing up, Jamal Fuego was insecure about his absolute lack of musical inclination until impulsively purchasing a piano keyboard at the age of fourteen. He taught himself how to play the keyboard, learning how to translate the ideas from his imagination into music. However, the melodies weren't enough. Eventually, at the age of sixteen, Jamal Fuego had aspirations of instead creating full atmospheres through the music as an emotion evoking experience. This was when he ventured into music production, which has been his staple role as a musician. 
                    
                From there, Jamal Fuego ventured into songwriting, vocal performance, and audio engineering. Ultimately, he couldn't escape the burning desire to reach a musical realm beyond imagination, and through the power of music he is fulfilling his destiny in life's journey as that kind of visionary. 
                    
                The top four artists that inspire Jamal Fuego are The Weeknd, Tame Impala, Bon Iver, and M83. Hints of their unique music flares are manifested through Jamal Fuego's artistic approach in his work. Beyond those artists, he harnesses inspiration from most styles of music- anywhere from Hip Hop to Film Scores to '80s New Wave. 
                    
                Jamal Fuego is currently working on his debut album “Deja Vu” which will display a collection of songs in a cohesive story that have been curated since he started with music production and songwriting in 2018. His previous releases "A Starless Sky" (2019), "Calling Out To You" (2020), and "Unassuming" (2020) have been removed from all streaming platforms as, instead, this album of over four years in the making will be a testament of rebirth for Jamal Fuego as an artist, and mark his embarking into fulfilling destiny.</p>

            <h3>The Vision</h3>
                <p> It is always been hard for me to explain myself and the way I see the world. This is a section that will eventually be filled with a full articulation illustrating what it's like to see the world through my eyes and mind. This section will be completed prior to and released alongside the prelude (11/11) to my debut album (12/08). I can't wait to share this story and this vision. It means everything to me as it is everything for me. It's what I've always felt inside and how I've always experienced life but I am ready now to let everyone else experience my experience.</p>
